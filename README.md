This is auto[3/5]

According to Thomas Ortlepp, he wrote auto1, auto2, and auto3...

There perhaps was a student who created auto4 at one point...
and then others created auto5.

This repository is an attempt to pull all the various incarnations
together and figure out a common "best" version of auto.

This is *very* much a work in progress.

There are several branches here...
  english
     an attempt to convert auto to english

  master
     the branch which hopefully will become 'defacto' one day

  vendor_ortlepp_auto3
     the original code given to me by Thomas Ortlepp

  vendor_ortlepp_auto3_20060213
     another version of the code, given to me later by Thomas Ortlepp
